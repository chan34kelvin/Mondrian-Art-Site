# Mondrian Art Site

Visit here: https://mondrian-art-kelvin-ck-chan.glitch.me/

This project is a website to creatively observe Mondrian-style art, offering multiple variations and unique features. It allows users to rotate the central element within the Mondrian, resulting in different compositions. Additionally, users can switch patterns to create entirely new Mondrian art. The project also includes a picture mode, where colors are replaced with images of the same hue, presenting a different art style. It aims to provide an engaging and immersive experience for art enthusiasts, encouraging exploration and appreciation of Mondrian's aesthetics.

This was a project site I built during my internship at Code Tenderloin.

I built it in glitch and moved to github for better visibility of the code and description.

# How To Use

- The middle square is designed to rotate when the button is clicked in the navbar.

- The left-right button can change mondrian patterns in the middle.

- The image mode changes all colors to images related to their respective colors.

**This is designed to be mobile friendly and responsive**

# More Creative Use
